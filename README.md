The architecture of CallSpy is modular and scalable, designed to handle real-time call data processing and storage efficiently. Key components include:

- **Data Collection Module:** Captures call data from various sources and formats it for processing.
- **Processing Engine:** Analyzes incoming call data, extracting meaningful metrics and patterns.
- **Storage Layer:** Utilizes databases optimized for time-series and relational data to store call logs and analysis results.
- **API Layer:** Provides RESTful endpoints for accessing call data and analytics.
- **User Interface:** A web-based dashboard for visualizing call statistics and managing settings.

The system is built with extensibility in mind, allowing integration with third-party communication platforms and analytics tools.
